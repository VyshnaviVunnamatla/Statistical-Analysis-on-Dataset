#Statistical Analysis on Time series Stock Price dataset


OVERVIEW

This project showcases statistical analysis on a dataset using Python. The analysis includes descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and data visualization techniques. The notebook is aimed at understanding data distributions, relationships, and deriving insights.


FILES

Statistical analysis.ipynb: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis steps.

CONTENTS

1. Data Exploration
   Data Loading and Cleaning: Initial steps to load the dataset, handle missing values, and clean the data for further analysis.
   Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset's distribution.
        Measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance are calculated.
        Distribution plots and histograms to visualize the data.

2. Hypothesis Testing
   T-tests: Comparing means between two groups to determine if there is a significant difference.
   ANOVA (Analysis of Variance): Testing differences between means for more than two groups.
   Chi-Square Tests: Assessing relationships between categorical variables.


PREREQUISITES

To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries installed:

    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    NumPy: For numerical operations.
    Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
    Statsmodels: For statistical tests and modeling.
    SciPy: For additional statistical functions.

You can install these packages using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels scipy
